 Good morning everyone. Let's start with the quick round of updates. Priya, can you go first? Sure. The dashboard and transaction space are fully functional now. I have integrated category filters and search. The only thing pending is linking the edit and delete buttons once Arjun finalizes the backend nodes. Great. Arjun, how is the backend update coming along? I have completed the endpoints for updating and deleting holdings. I am testing them with postman right now. Once I confirm stability, I will push to the dev branch by this evening. Perfect. Make sure you also include authentication checks on those routes. Yes, already handled that with Firebase tokens. Nice. Kavya, any updates on design? Yes, I have finalized the new dark mode palette and made some responsive layout tweaks for mobile screens. I will share the figma link later. I have started regression testing on the portfolio module. So far, no critical perks, but I found a few layout misalignments on smaller screens. I document them in Gera. Excellent. Let's start with a complete integration test by Friday. That way we can start deployment on Monday. Should I begin wiring up the front end with the new endpoints tomorrow? Yes, that works. Once Arjun pushes the code, pull the latest and start connecting. Anything else? Nothing from my side. Great. Then let's wrap up.
